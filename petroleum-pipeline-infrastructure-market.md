<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Gathering</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The petroleum pipeline infrastructure market consists of two main types: transmission and gathering. Transmission pipelines are long-distance pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products over vast distances, connecting production areas to refineries and distribution centers. These pipelines are usually larger in diameter and require high-pressure systems to ensure efficient delivery. On the other hand, gathering pipelines are shorter pipelines that collect and transport oil and gas from various wells within a specific production area to a central processing facility or storage unit. These pipelines are typically smaller in size and operate at lower pressures.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Fire Barrier Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flexible fire barrier sealant market can be categorized into two types: elastomeric type and intumescent type. Elastomeric sealants are made from rubber-like materials that expand when exposed to fire, forming a protective barrier. They are often used in joints and gaps to prevent the spread of fire and smoke. On the other hand, intumescent sealants contain fire-resistant chemicals that expand significantly when heated, creating an insulating foam-like layer that seals gaps and prevents fire from spreading. Both types of sealants play a crucial role in enhancing fire protection in buildings and structures.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Guided Wave Radar Level Transmitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rod Level Transmitter</li><li>Cable Level Transmitter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The guided wave radar level transmitter market includes two main types: rod level transmitter and cable level transmitter. </p><p>A rod level transmitter uses a metallic rod to measure the liquid or solid level. It emits microwave signals that travel down the rod and reflect back when they encounter the material's surface. The time taken for the signal to return helps determine the level.</p><p>On the other hand, a cable level transmitter uses a flexible cable for level measurement. Microwaves are sent through the cable, and the reflections are analyzed to determine the level. Both types offer accurate and reliable level measurements for various industrial applications.</p></p>

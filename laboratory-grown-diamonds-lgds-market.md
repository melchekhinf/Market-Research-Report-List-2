<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory-grown Diamonds (LGDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD</li><li>HPHT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The laboratory-grown diamond (LGDs) market consists of two main types: CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) and HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature). CVD diamonds are created by placing a small diamond seed in a chamber, which is then filled with carbon-rich gases that are heated to high temperatures. The carbon vapor slowly deposits onto the seed, creating layer by layer until a diamond is formed. HPHT diamonds, on the other hand, are created by subjecting a diamond seed to extreme heat and pressure, simulating the natural diamond formation process deep within the Earth. Both methods result in high-quality diamonds that possess identical chemical and physical properties to natural diamonds.</p></p>

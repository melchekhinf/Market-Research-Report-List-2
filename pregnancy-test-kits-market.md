<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pregnancy Test Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blood Test</li><li>Urine Test</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pregnancy test kits are available in two main types: blood test and urine test. Blood tests are performed at a medical facility and can detect pregnancy as early as 6-8 days after conception. These tests measure the level of hCG hormone in the blood. On the other hand, urine tests are more commonly used and can be done at home. They detect pregnancy by measuring the hCG hormone in the urine and are generally accurate after the missed period. Both tests provide reliable results, but blood tests are more sensitive and can detect pregnancy earlier than urine tests.</p></p>

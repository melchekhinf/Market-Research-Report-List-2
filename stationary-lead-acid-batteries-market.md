<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Lead Acid Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cell</li><li>Valve Regulated Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stationary lead acid batteries market includes two types of batteries: open cell and valve regulated. Open cell batteries have vented cells, allowing gases to escape during normal operation. These batteries require regular maintenance, such as adding water to the cells. Valve regulated batteries, on the other hand, are sealed and do not require maintenance. These batteries use a valve to regulate the release of gases, making them more suitable for applications where maintenance is difficult or impractical.</p></p>
